We want to implement the final UI/UX direction for the service 
"계약서 리스크 하이라이터 (Contract Risk Highlighter)".

🎯 Core Experience Goal:
Users must understand risky clauses directly ON the contract text, 
and only open a deeper report IF they want more information.

=========================
UI/UX Requirements
=========================

1) Inline Highlight First (Document-Centered Design)
- Extracted contract text should be the main view
- Risky clauses should be highlighted with color coding:
    🔴 High Risk / 🟡 Moderate Issue / 🟢 Safe
- Hover or tap on each highlighted text shows quick tooltip:
    • 1-line reason why it's risky

2) Progressive Disclosure
- Do NOT show all details at once in a separate panel
- Instead add a floating button:
    “🗣 전체 리포트 보기 / 이렇게 말해보세요”
- Clicking opens a modal/slide-in panel WITH:
    A) Grouped risky clauses by category (wage, rest, termination, etc.)
    B) Legal basis & supporting explanation
    C) Communication script for each problematic clause:
        Example: “해당 조항은 근로기준법 제○조에 따라 수정 요청드립니다.”
    D) Option in future to export/share (placeholder OK)

3) Mobile-First Behavior
- Text highlight tap triggers tooltip (no hover)
- Bottom CTA persistent “전체 리포트” button on phones

4) Emotional & Trust Design Principle
- Tone: Friendly but reliable — we are here to help, not scare
- Keep spacing wide and layout simple
- Reduce user cognitive load but keep the credibility of a legal tool

=========================
UI Structure Summary
=========================

Main Screen:
- Upload Contract
- Extract → Show text with inline highlights
- Hover/Tap = quick guidance
- Sticky CTA (bottom): “상세 리포트 보기”

Report Screen (Modal or Slide Panel):
- Detailed legal advice
- Grouping by labor law categories
- Copy-ready negotiation scripts

=========================
Outcome
=========================
The user should:
✔ See immediately where problems are in the document
✔ Understand why with a tiny action
✔ Get actionable language only when they choose to view deeper details

=========================
First Implementation Step
=========================
Please implement:
- The inline highlight interaction
- Hover/tap tooltip
- Placeholder modal for detailed results
- Layout separation based on this structure

Visual polish and content population will follow afterward.
